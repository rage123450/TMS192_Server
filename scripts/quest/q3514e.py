# Apparently the script is also supposed to check if you're below 20% of your Max HP before leading into the dialogue below
# This is...really finicky since the Sorcerer's Potion tries to kill you using only your base HP, which doesn't take any HP bonuses into account
# Thus, the HP check will be skipped over entirely
# Side effect: you can just drop the potion and it still counts for finishing the quest
