sm.sendSay("2. I'm the only one who's woken up. I don't know why, but I get this feeling... "
"Could the Black Mage's seal be weakening?")
sm.sendSay("3. I want to go outside and check on Maple World, but I'm only level 10. "
"No, I still can't believe it... I can't be level 10!")
sm.sendSay("Brr! I don't know how long I've been asleep, but I'm freezing to death! "
"Just how powerful was that curse?")
sm.sendSay("Okay, so I was injured when I was cursed, and I may have been in the ice for decades. "
"I guess it makes sense that I'd be weaker. But...it's not fair! I'm the ruler of the Elves! "
"I can't be level 10!!")
sm.sendSay("Right, hold it together, hold it together... "
"I need to make sure there's not anything wrong with me.")
